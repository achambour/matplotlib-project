Data visualization and analysis project involving Python's Data Science Stack libraries: Pandas and Matplotlib

The main goal is to make use of Python's libraries to analyse data from 3 databases that hold information on rollercoasters across different parks in the world. The two Golden Award Winners CSV files include the ranking of rollercoasters according to their material (wood or steel) with additional information on each ranked rollercoaster (locatio, supplier, points, year of rank etc.). On the other hand, the roller coaster dataframe includes more detailed information on each rollercoaster (seating type, height, speed, length manufacturer, status of operation etc.) 

Based on these 3 dataframes, an analysis of the raw data was conducted using Pandas to draw informative patterns alongside visualizations using Matplotlib. Several functions were created plotting line and bar graphs, histograms, pie charts and scatter plots.
